# Text_Mining

# 🧠 Text Mining Toolkit

A comprehensive project for performing **Text Mining** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** tasks using Python. This toolkit covers end-to-end processes from preprocessing raw text data to extracting insights using machine learning models and NLP techniques.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔤 Text Preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization)
- 📊 Text Representation (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe)
- 📈 Exploratory Text Analysis (word clouds, frequency plots, n-grams)
- 🏷️ Text Classification (sentiment analysis, spam detection)
- 📚 Topic Modeling with LDA
- 🧠 Document Clustering with K-means
- 💬 Named Entity Recognition & POS Tagging (using spaCy)
- 🛠️ Tools: `NLTK`, `spaCy`, `scikit-learn`, `gensim`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
